# OBD_BO
OBD-II breakout board to screw terminals or pin headers.

You put an OBD-II connector at one end. You put screw terminals or pin headers at the other end. The big fat trace going to pin 16 is for power so make sure that the OBD-II connector pin 16 is oriented correctly. Most OBD-II connectors means that the OBD-II connector goes on the bottom of the PCB.
